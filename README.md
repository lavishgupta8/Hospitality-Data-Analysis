## Problem Statement 


Imperial Grands, a leading 5-star hotel chain in India, is facing declining revenue and increased competition in the luxury hospitality sector. The absence of internal data analytics expertise has limited its ability to make data-driven decisions, hindering its growth and market position.


As a Data Analyst, I examined the dataset to identify revenue trends, performance gaps, and competitive challenges faced by Imperial Grands in the luxury hotel sector.


My task was to analyze the data and highlight the key factors contributing to the decline in revenue. By identifying patterns in bookings, occupancy, and customer preferences, I aimed to uncover opportunities for improving profitability.

## Being a Data Analyst, my responsibilities are:

Understanding the dataset and identifying key revenue drivers.

Performing EDA to detect patterns and anomalies in bookings and revenue.

Interpreting results to generate actionable business insights.

Presenting findings using charts and visualizations for better decision-making.

## Analysis Workflow
